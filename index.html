            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>As a Career Center Instructor at Goodwill Industries of Colombia Willamette, my role extends beyond mere instruction, encompassing a holistic approach to education. Daily, I engage with small groups of students, community members, and fellow Goodwill employees, equipping them with skills necessary for performing moderate to complex tasks using tools like Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and other software essential in the business landscape, including virtual communication programs.

                Simultaneously, I am honing my skills in the Code Fellows Software Development program, with the aim of becoming a part-time coding instructor within my organization.
                
                As a recent graduate from Willamette University with a degree in Philosophy and Global Cultural Studies, I'm wholeheartedly dedicated to personal growth and expanding my network. This year, my focus is on building new connections that foster the crossroads of education, technology, and professional development.</p>
